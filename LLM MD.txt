You are a UNICEF data analyst. Based on the integrated dataset **‘unicef_hiv_tech.csv’** containing 14 fields, summarize three key insights for the *“HIV/AIDS Child Response Strategy.”*
Each insight must directly answer the given analytical question and specify which field(s) support the conclusion.

1. **Treatment Efficacy Analysis:**
   Identify three countries in the most recent year where the number of children living with HIV (`PLHIV_0_19`) is high but ART coverage (`ART_Coverage_0_14_Pct`) remains below 50%. Analyze trends in child AIDS deaths (`Annual_AIDS_Deaths_0_14`) in these countries and propose policy priorities based on the observed relationship between low treatment coverage and mortality rates.

2. **Prevention Performance and Regional Disparity:**
   Determine which region shows the **fastest** and **slowest** decline in new infections (`Annual_New_Infections_0_14`). Explain how the gap between these regions correlates with the rate of mother-to-child transmission (`MTCT_Rate_Pct`), focusing on whether improved prevention programs correspond with lower MTCT rates.

3. **Social Impact and Orphanhood:**
   Identify the group of countries where the number of AIDS orphans (`AIDS_Orphans_0_17`) is large in absolute terms but the number of children receiving ART (`Reported_ART_Number`) is relatively low. Analyze the regional characteristics (`unicef_region`) of these countries and explain what this implies for the design of future social support and child protection programs.
